   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to ggame!
=================

The simple cross-platform sprite and game platform for 
`Brython Server <https://github.com/tiggerntatie/brython-server>`_ and 
`Runpython <https://runpython.org>`_.

Ggame stands for a couple of things: “good game” (of course!) and also 
“git game” or “github game” because it is designed to operate with 
`Runpython <https://runpython.org>`_ in concert with 
`Github <https://github.com>`_ as its backend file store.
